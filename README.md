AN EXPERIMENTAL STUDY OF THE EFFECT OF AESTHETICS ON THE USABILITY OF DATA VISUALISATION

This project investigates how the integration of aesthetics and sensory stimulus within data visualization can transform the way audiences engage with information, evoking deeper and more empathetic responses. the project combines live aqi (air quality index) data with kinetic sculpture to create a visual understanding of air pollution. By merging projection and dynamic movement, the piece generates a multi-sensory narrative that brings the data to life, engaging viewers on both intellectual and emotional levels. The project then studies audiences reactions and interactions to explore how the design and presentation of data can evoke empathy, amplifying the messageâ€™s impact and establishing data visualization as a tool for meaningful political art.

This project examines how the presentation of information influences perception and shapes interactions with data. It aims to uncover the relationship between visual design and audience engagement, focusing on how aesthetics can deepen understanding and emotional connection. 

What role does colour, form, and motion play in shaping the emotional resonance of data visualization?
Can aesthetic choices help bridge the gap between complex data sets and public understanding? 
How can sensory or immersive elements enhance the impact of visual data representations?
